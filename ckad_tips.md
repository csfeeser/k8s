## CKAD TIPS:

1. TMUX is installed on the CKAD environment! Use it to your advantage!
0. vim/vi is installed on the CKAD environment; you MUST be FAST with this tool! You may fail the exam due to being a slow typist instead of not knowing Kubernetes!
0. You may use all of kubernetes.io on the exam! You MUST be FAST at finding what you need out of this website! Don't spend a lot of time looking stuff up.
0. The CKAD exam environment is in a remote desktop; the browser can only open kubernetes.io, so no outside web resources allowed :(
0. ALWAYS run the `kubectl config use-context` command FIRST before you even READ the task question!
