    `kubectl create ns challenge`

0. Give `tony` the following permissions:

    In the namespace "challenge", tony can:

    - [pods] - get, list, watch, create, update, delete
    - [deployments] - get, list, watch, create, update, delete

    In all namespaces, tony can:

    - [pods] - get, list, watch

0. Add your new user to your `kubeconfig`. Test that your permissions are correct with `kubectl auth`!
