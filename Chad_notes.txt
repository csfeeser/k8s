                            ╲╱ container port
sudo docker run -d -p 2345:5000 registry:2 <-- name of image
            ^         ^ local port
            |create container

docker tag <-- assign an image a tag, which is used to identify the registry it belongs to

metadata:
  name: zork
spec:
  containers:
    - name: demo
      image: nginx:1.7.9
      # step 2: mount the volume inside the container(s)
      volumeMounts:
        - name: chads_rockin_volume
          # at what path can the content of the volume be accessed?
          mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
          # only use mountpath by itself if you are ok with overwriting the ENTIRE directory!!!
          subPath: nginx.conf
          
          
# step 1: mount the configmap as a volume inside the Pod
